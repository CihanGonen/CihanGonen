### Hi there 👋, I'm Cihan Gönen!

Developed my skills in web area by myself. This way I learned how to read documentation. I can learn new technologies and have a good grasp on them easily. Created many web pages using only html,css and also more advenced technologies.


Love creating useful web pages and share with my friends. Now I want to use my skills to work with a team to create bigger and more exciting projects. I want to work in the web development area using Javascript techologies because this is what I enjoy doing.


In college I learned the theory of things and also practiced them with projects. We always tried to write code sustainable, reliable, and pure so I always care about my code quality. This way it can be understood by my team mates.
